# Rideshare Price Analysis for ALY 6010

## Course Project Overview
This repository contains the final project for the ALY 6010 - Probability Theory and Introductory Statistics course at Northeastern University. The project entails a detailed analysis of Uber and Lyft rideshare data in Boston, MA, focusing on pricing dynamics, ride distribution, and the effects of various factors such as time, weather, and ride type on ride fares.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset spans Uber and Lyft rides in Boston from November 26 to December 18, 2018, featuring data on ride times, locations, distances, prices, and environmental conditions. With 693071 observations and 58 attributes initially, the dataset underwent significant cleaning and manipulation to streamline the analysis.

### Key Attributes Include:
- **price:** Ride fare in USD
- **distance:** Total ride distance
- **cab_type:** Uber or Lyft
- **timestamp:** Time of the ride
- **pickup_location:** Start location of the ride
- **drop_location:** End location of the ride
- **conditions:** Weather conditions during the ride

## Analysis Highlights
- **Data Cleaning and Manipulation:** Extensive preprocessing, including handling missing values, removing duplicates, and refining features for more insightful analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** In-depth exploration of ride fares, distances, surge pricing, and other factors affecting ride dynamics.
- **Statistical Testing:** Hypothesis testing to compare Uber and Lyft on various parameters, such as surge multipliers and ride distances.
- **Regression Analysis:** Building models to predict ride fares based on multiple factors, with insights into model efficacy and predictor significance.

## Visualizations
This project utilizes a range of visualizations to convey the findings, including bar graphs, density maps, sunburst charts, and more, providing a comprehensive view of the rideshare landscape in Boston.
